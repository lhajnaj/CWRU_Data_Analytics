# NBA Players Salary and Stats

Our group decided to create a data visualization dashboard for NBA players salaries, stats and basic information. During the process of providing all this information we had to import CSV files, rename multiple column headers and merge the three different pandas dataframes into one dataframe. 

**We were also able to create a special feature, called *Salary Generator*, more clearly described below in the Project Features section.**

## Project Details

### Gathering Data
Our data sources for this extraction came from *Kaggle* which gave us detailed and advanced player stats from the 1950’s  all the way through the 2018-2019 NBA season for all players. For the information of the stats it gave information on everything from points scored in a game to how many minutes they played each game… etc. The other source we used was *Basketball-Reference*. This resource provided contract information for the 2019-2024 seasons.

### Project Summary
In this project we will be looking to find relationships between the **players’ salaries** versus their statistics from the 2018-2019  NBA season. We will be comparing statistics such as *points scored, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals and age **against salary**.* The purpose of these comparisons is to see if the top salary earners actually do lead the NBA in any or all of these categories. 

### Project Features
The graphs that will be developed are going to be utilizing multiple different charts to show how salaries correlate to certain statistics provided earlier. Some of the charts that might be used on our dashboard are a **scatter plot, bar chart, box plot, radar chart and a bubble chart.** The dashboard will feature a **drop down menu** that will allow the user to pick the statistic they find interesting to compare against salary. 

In addition, we have created a ***Salary Generator*** feature that will be able to predict a prospective player's salary if they were to play in the NBA based on **user input** of statistics. This feature was made possible by **machine learning**.
